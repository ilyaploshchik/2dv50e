## MetaStackVis: Visually-Assisted Performance Evaluation of Metamodels in Stacking Ensemble Learning 

Stacking, or stacked generalization, is a technique in ensemble learning where multiple base models, or "weak learners," are trained and combined to form a metamodel with improved predictive power. The [ISOVIS](https://cs.lnu.se/isovis/) research group at LNU has created [StackGenVis](https://github.com/angeloschatzimparmpas/StackGenVis), a visual analytics system that helps users optimize performance metrics, manage input data, including selecting features, and choose top-performing algorithms. The current version of StackGenVis uses a single Linear Regression metamodel. This work aims to investigate the impact of alternative metamodels on the predictive performance of StackGenVis using provided data and charts for comparison. </br>
